In a warehouse you obtain $20\%$ discount but you must pay a $15\%$
sales tax.

%%Square root example 1
\begin{example}
Let $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ on $I=[-1,1]$. Can the Mean Value Theorem be applied to $f(x)$ on the interval $I$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice{No, because $f(x)$ is not continuous on $I$}
\choice[correct]{No, because $f(x)$ is not differentiable on $I$}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{explanation}
  \begin{expandable}
    $f(x)$ is continuous on $I$. $f'(x)=\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$, and $f'(0)$ does not exist.
  \end{expandable}
\end{explanation}

\begin{python}
  import turtle               # allows us to use the turtles library
  wn = turtle.Screen()        # creates a graphics window
  alex = turtle.Turtle()      # create a turtle named alex
  alex.forward(150)           # tell alex to move forward by 150 units
  alex.left(90)               # turn by 90 degrees
  alex.forward(75)            # complete the second side of a rectangle
\end{python}



\begin{question}
Which would save you more money: To have the tax calculated first or
the discount?
\begin{explanation}
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Apply the tax first.}
\choice{Apply the discount first.} 
\choice[correct]{It doesn't matter.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{explanation}
\end{question}

Now that you have an answer, let's see if we can figure out why it is
correct. 

\begin{question}
Suppose the item you are interested in buying is 100
dollars. Now suppose the tax is computed first. What is the cost of
the item including tax?
\begin{explanation}
\begin{hint}
What is $15\%$ of $100$?  
\end{hint}
The cost of the item and the tax is
$\answer{115}$.
\end{explanation}
 Now take your answer from before (the cost of the item and the tax),
and apply the $20\%$ discount. How much is the total cost now?
\begin{explanation}
The total cost is $\answer{92}$. 
\end{explanation}
\end{question}

Now let's compute the total cost computing the discount first. 

\begin{question}
If the item cost $100$ dollars before the discount, what is the cost
before tax?
\begin{explanation}
The cost of the item with the discount, but before tax is $\answer{80}$. 
\end{explanation}
 Now if you apply the $15\%$ tax, what is the total cost?
\begin{explanation}
The total cost is $\answer{92}$.
\end{explanation} 
\end{question}

\begin{exploration}
What happened? Does this always work? Give a general explanation.
\begin{freeResponse}
Try different numbers, what property of multiplication are we
utilizing here?
