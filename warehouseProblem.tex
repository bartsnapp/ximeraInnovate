\begin{question}
In a warehouse you obtain $20\%$ discount but you must pay a $15\%$
sales tax. 


 Which would save you more money: To have the tax calculated
  first or the discount?
\begin{solution}
\begin{multiple-choice}
\choice{Apply the tax first.}
\choice{Apply the discount first.} 
\choice[correct]{It doesn't matter.}
\end{multiple-choice}
\end{solution}
Now that you have an answer, let's see if we can figure out if it is
correct or not. Suppose the item you are interested in buying is 100
dollars. Now suppose the tax is computed first. What is the cost of
the item including tax?
\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
What is $15\%$ of $100$?  
\end{hint}
The cost of the item and the tax is
\(\$\)\answer{115}.
\end{solution}
 Now take your answer from before (the cost of the item and the tax),
and apply the $20\%$ discount. How much is the total cost now?
\begin{solution}
The total cost is \(\$\)\answer{92}. 
\end{solution}
 Now let's compute the total cost computing the discount first. If the
item cost $100$ dollars before the discount, what is the cost before tax?
\begin{solution}
The cost of the item with the discount, but before tax is \answer{80} dollars. 
\end{solution}
 Now if you apply the $15\%$ tax, what is the total cost?
\begin{solution}
The total cost is \(\$\)\answer{92}.
\end{solution} 
 What happened? Does this always work? Give a general explanation.
\begin{free-response}
Try different numbers, what property of multiplication are we
utilizing here?
